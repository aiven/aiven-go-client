Aiven is a next-generation managed cloud services platform with a focus on
ease of adoption, high fault resilience, customer peace of mind and advanced
features at competitive price points. See https://aiven.io/ for more
information about the backend service.

This is the official Aiven SDK for Go. This SDK provides full implementation of
the Aiven API but no command line interface. If you're looking for a command
line client, check out the [Aiven Python Client](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client/).

This client is used by the [Aiven Terraform Provider](https://github.com/aiven/terraform-provider-aiven).

The original version of the Aiven Go client was written and maintained by
Jelmer Snoeck (https://github.com/jelmersnoeck).
